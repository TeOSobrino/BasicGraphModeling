# Graphs
Basic graph algorithms using linked list representation, Eulerian Paths, DFS, BFS, MST and minimum cost.

Further improvement is to replicate all the algorthims using matrix representation for graphs.

Main.c file defines a program that compares the minimum path and the path produced by the MST.
